# Workshop

This is an open part of a developing game. Although this game has some specifics, presented classes and functions can be useful to build a prototype or have a look at Unreal Engine's possibilities. If you have any recommendations or questions, you are always welcome!

### Few words about the game

For now a short description reads: "Journey about rethinking the values of life in form of turn-based videogame. Combine abilities of diverse craftsmen to fight challenges in massive construction based on taming figurative beasts". As this game has no budget it's made by open community, so if you want to participate in development or just send some ideas and check news there is a discord channel for that: https://discord.gg/sazKY9J

### Repository Structure

**Source/Workshop** contains all needed code.
